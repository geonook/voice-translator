MANUAL ICON CREATION NEEDED:

Chrome Web Store requires PNG icons. Please create the following files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Recommended approach:
1. Open chrome-extension/create-png-icons.html in your browser
2. Click "Generate Extension Icons"
3. Download each icon size
4. Save as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png in this directory

Alternative:
- Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
- Create square icons with microphone symbol
- Use gradient background from #667eea to #764ba2
- Save as PNG format

The icons should represent a microphone or translation concept.
